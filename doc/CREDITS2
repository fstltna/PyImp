Thanks to Ed, Bob and Mike I have been able to fix this client to work with the the empire-4.3.xx server.  This client has not worked since about 2007 and now it does because they helped to find bugs.  

Thanks to Ed for helping me post it and also to Bob for providing a class to handel read exceptions.
 
Thanks: WM Fittge
